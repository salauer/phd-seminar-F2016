## Study Design

![](figures/nhs-study-design.jpg)

- 121,700 US female registered nurses aged 30-55 enrolled in 1976
- 32,826 contributed blood
- 146 contracted RA between 1989/90 and 2004

## Study Design

![](figures/nhs-study-design.jpg)

- 126 RA patients had blood drawn in 1989/90
- 337 controls matched on clinical/bloodwork covariates
- 122 cases and 123 controls (randomly sampled from 337) had blood genotyped in 2004

## Study Design

![](figures/nhs-study-design-2.jpg)

- $T^\dagger$ indicates time from blood draw to disease onset
- Data from prior to 1989 not used
- $C$ is right-censored time, unclear if always 2004 or not

## Study Design: Covariates of Interest

- Clinical covariates (taken at time of blood draw)
    - Age
    - Smoking (in pack-years)
    - Alcohol (cumulative intake)
- Blood sample biomarkers (regarding inflammation)
    - IL-6
    - sTNFRII
- Genetic data
    - 39 SNPs identified with RA risks

## Challenges: Sampling

- Not simple random sample due to matching
    - Needs to be accounted for in risk model
- Further difficulties due to protection of some individuals

## Challenges: Time-varying effects

- Certain biomarkers have strong correlation at short-term predictions, but not long-term predictions
    - Most survival models ignore this and consider biomarkers time-invariant
- Also, there are a large number of covariates relative to the subcohort size

## Challenges: Evaluation

- ROC method not available for study designs that are all of the following:
    - Multi-phase
    - Time-dependent
    - Multivariate
    - Accounting for outcome-dependent sampling
- Need incremental value (IncV) metric for models with and without markers of interest
    - Didn't exist for 3-phase studies
    - Sequential finite population sampling induces complex correlation between observations
