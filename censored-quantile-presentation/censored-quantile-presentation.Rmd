## Background on quantile regression

- Each covariate effect varies by quantile.
- For event time of interest $Y$ and covariate vector $W$, a quantile regression model assumes the $\tau$th quantile of $Y$ is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{Y}(\tau)&= F^{-1}_{Y}(\tau)\equiv \inf \{y: F_{Y}(y)\geq \tau\}, \quad \tau\in(0,1) \\
Q_{Y}(\tau|W)&= W^{T}\beta(\tau)
\end{aligned}
$$

- $Q_{Y}(\tau|W) \equiv inf{y: pr(Y \leq y | W) \geq \tau}$ denotes $\tau$th conditional quantile of $Y$ given $W$.
- Describes linear relationship between $W$ and $\tau$th quantile.
- Quantile function is minimum value of time $T$ below which subject will fall $p\times 100$ percent of times.

## Partially functional effects
- $\beta(\tau)$ represents effect of $W$ on $Q_{Y}(\tau|W)$
- Coefficients for $W$ are allowed to be function of $\tau$ meaning they are allowed to be related to both shape and location of distribution, not just a measure of central tendency.
- Partially Function Effects:
    - A model which includes a mixture of constant and varying effects.
    - $\tau$-varying coefficients correspond to effects allowed to vary by quantile group. 
- May be preferred to fully functional model due to more accurate quantile prediction for small $\tau$

## Censored quantile regression
If the response variable is subject to censoring, the conditional mean is not identifiable wihtout additional distributional assumptions, but the conditional quantile is often identifiable.

## Censored quantile regression
Let $T$ and $C$ denote survival and censoring time.

$X = \min(T,C)$ and $\delta = I(T \leq C)$ where $I(\cdot)$ is indicator function.

$Y = \log T$

Partition $W$ into constant and quantile varying effects
$$
W=(Z^{T}, V^{T})^{T}
$$

$Z$ is $p\times 1$ vector of $\tau$ varying effects.

$V$ is $q\times 1$ vector of constant effects.

Data: $\{(X_{i}, \delta_{i}, Z_{i}, V_{i}),\quad i=1,...,n\}$

\textbf{Notes}

(a) Cumulative Distribution Function: $F_{T}(t|Z,V)= \Pr(T \leq t|Z,V)$
(b) Survival Function: $S(t)= 1-F_{T}(T|Z,V)$
(c) Cumulative Hazard Function: $\Lambda(t)= -\log S(t)= -\log (1-F_{T}(T|Z,V))$

## Partially functional quantile regression model

$$
Q_{Y}(\tau|Z,V) = Z^{T}\beta(\tau) + V^{T}\gamma, \quad \tau \in (0,1)
$$

- How do we account for the censoring?
- Monotone profile estimating equation!

## Martingale process

- One jump counting process: gives information about when events occur. i.e. If person $i$ is "failure" by time $t$.
$$
N_{i}(t)= I(X_{i}\leq t, \delta_{i}=1)
$$

- Indicator if survival/censored time is below $t$
$$
Y_{i}(t)= I(X_{i}\geq t)
$$

- Martingale counting process wrt $F_{t}$
$$
M(t)= N(t)-\Lambda(t)
$$

    - Non-decreasing step function minus a compensator

- Mean-zero white noise
$$
E[M(t)|V,Z]=0
$$
    

## Estimating equation (Peng \& Huang, 2008)

Extend the Martingale representation of the Nelson-Aalen estimator of cumulative hazard to produce an estimating equation.

- NA estimator
$$
\hat{H}(t)-H(t)= \int_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{R(s)}\partial M(s)
$$

- Estimating equation
$$
\begin{split}
    \text{E} \Bigg [ n^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\omega_{i} \bigg (N_{i} \exp \{Z_{i}^{T} \beta_{0} (\tau) + V_{i}^{T}\gamma_{0}\} - \\ \int_{0}^{\tau} I \Big [X_{i} \geq \exp \{Z_{i}^{T} \beta_{0} (u) + V_{i}^{T}\gamma_{0}\} \Big ] dH(u) \bigg ) \Bigg ] \\ = 0
\end{split}
$$

- $\beta_{0}$ and $\gamma_{0}$ are true values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
- Indicator is $\Lambda_{i}=\exp \{Z_{i}^{T} \beta_{0} (\tau + V_{i}^{T} \gamma_{0}) \}$

## Computing Algorithm
- Step 1: Get $\hat{\beta}(\tau_{j}, \gamma)$ with $\gamma$ fixed.

$$
\begin{split}
n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_{i} \Bigg ( N_{i} \exp \{Z_{i}^{T} \hat{\beta}(\tau_{j}) + V_{i}^{T}\gamma\} - \\
\sum_{k=0}^{j-1} I \bigg [X_{i} \geq \exp \{Z_{i}^{T} \hat{\beta} (\tau_k, \gamma) + V_{i}^{T} \gamma)\} \bigg ] \Big ( H(\tau_{k+1}) - H(\tau_k) \Big) \Bigg) \\
=0
\end{split}
$$

Solve for $\beta(\tau_j)$

## Computing Algorithm 
- Step 2: Get $\hat{\gamma}$ with $\hat{\beta}(\tau_j)$ fixed.
$$
\begin{split}
n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} V_{i} \Bigg( N_{i} \exp \{ Z_{i}^{T} \hat{\beta}(\tau_{j}) + V_{i}^{T} \gamma \} - \\
\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} I \bigg [X_{i} \geq \exp \{Z_{i}^{T} \hat{\beta} (\tau_k, \gamma) + V_{i}^{T} \gamma \} \bigg ] \Big (H(\tau_{k+1})-H(\tau_k ) \Big) \Bigg ) \\
=0
\end{split}
$$

Solve for $\gamma$

- Step 3...

Iterate until convergence criteria is met.
